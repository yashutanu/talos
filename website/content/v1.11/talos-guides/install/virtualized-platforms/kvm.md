Talos is known to work on KVM.

We don't yet have a documented guide specific to KVM; however, you can have a look at our
[Vagrant & Libvirt guide]({{< relref "./vagrant-libvirt" >}}) which uses KVM for virtualization.

If you run into any issues, our [community](https://slack.dev.talos-systems.io/) can probably help!

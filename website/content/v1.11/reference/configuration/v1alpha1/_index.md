    Package v1alpha1 contains definition of the `v1alpha1` configuration document.

    Even though the machine configuration in Talos Linux is multi-document, at the moment
    this configuration document contains most of the configuration options.

    It is expected that new configuration options will be added as new documents, and existing ones
    migrated to their own documents.
